# GUESSING GAME

This is a simple game developed with python fundamentals. This idea was suggested by the course [Python 3 parte 1: Introdução à nova versão da linguagem](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/python-3-introducao-a-nova-versao-da-linguagem).
I made some changes to the code, but the essential idea is shown in the course. Error and exception handling is not implemented.

## HOW TO PLAY ?

### Goal: 
The goal of this game is to hit the secret number which is in a range from 1 to 100.
There are 3 levels. For each level, you have an attempts number according to the values shown below:

Levels | Attempts number
--------- | ------
Easy | 20
Medium | 10
Hard | 5

### Demo Video:
This is a quick video showing how the code works.

### Future changes:
In the future I plan to implement this game using Object Orientation and add error and exception handling.
