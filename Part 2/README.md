# Hangman Game

This is a simple and well-known game developed with python fundamentals, especially using functions. This idea was suggested by the course [Python 3 parte 2: Avan√ßando na linguagem](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/python-3-avancando-na-linguagem).
I made some changes to the code, but the essential idea is shown in the course. Error and exception handling is not implemented.

## HOW TO PLAY ?

A secret word is chosen at random considering the chosen theme. There are 10 attempts to hit what is the secret word. 
You can add others themes by putting a txt file containing several words of the new theme in the directory where the python file is located. For this, each word must be on a line of the new txt file. There can be not more than one word per line.

### Demo Video:
This is a quick video showing how the code works.

### Future changes:
In the future I plan to implement this game using Object Orientation, add error and exception handling, and connect the application to the database that has the words grouped by theme.
